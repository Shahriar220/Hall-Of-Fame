Functionalities : 
1. Can make youtube playlist 
2. Add and remove video 
3. Make playlist by Category
4. Update,add,delete video and playlist

How it works - 

1. Just paste a youtube video it will fetch the title and video id. We use youtube api to do that. To make request used default django requests package.
Ajax was used to search that video without refresh the page. 

2. Every user has a dashboard of his own. To protect that we have use decorators.

3. Default log in and signup views are used here.

4. Two python forms is used here. Working with python form is a bit different and pain. 

5. Seed is used here in case any of the user delete the database and make migrations he/she can find his previous playlist. Can be called as backup database.
